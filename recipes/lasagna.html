    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. 
        Lasagna can refer to either the type of 
        noodle or to the typical lasagna dish 
        which is a dish made with several layers 
        of lasagna sheets with sauce and other 
        ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in 
        between the lasagna noodles.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>Originally, the word lasagna was used to 
        describe a pot in which food was being 
        cooked rather than the pasta itself.  
        Lasagna recipes have been around for ages,
        dating back to as early as the thirteenth 
        century.  Today, lasagnas come in all 
        kinds of varieties from veggies and cream sauces to 
        traditional sauce and cheese lasagnas as well as meat lasagnas.

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Italian Sausage and Lean ground beef</li>
        <li>Onion and two cloves of Garlic</li>
        <li>2 cans of Tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tbs sugar</li>
        <li>fresh parsley</li>
        <li>ried basil leaves</li> 
        <li>fennel seeds</li>  
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>mozarella and parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
